# TMCMC
In Monte Carlo folder, there is an example to estimate pi 

In MCMCpurdue folder, it shows how to sample from an give distribution by using MCMC algorithm, i.e., Metropolis Algorithm. Please refer to Purdue Predictive Lab for your
background.

In 2DShearBuilding Folder, I updated 8 parameters of a 8-story 2D shear building in time domain and modal domain. Theses 8 parameters are stiffmess in each floor. In time 
domain, acceleration data is used; in modal domain, natural frequencies (eigenvalues) and mode shapes (eigenvectors) are used to update the paramters.

In modal domain, this is samples of 3 paramters out of 8 from stage 0 to last stage:

This is pair grid plot at last stage:
